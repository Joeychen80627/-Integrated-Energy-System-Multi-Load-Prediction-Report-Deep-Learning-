## Key Findings

### Correlation Analysis

- **Electric–Cooling Load:**  
  0.795 (strong positive correlation)

- **Electric–Heating Load:**  
  -0.674 (moderate negative correlation)

- **Cooling–Heating Load:**  
  -0.902 (very strong negative correlation)

### Model Performance Comparison

#### Electric Load (Target 0)
- **Best Model:** CNN + LSTM (MSE: 0.0094, R²: 0.5474)
- **Second Best:** CNN + GRU

#### Cooling Load (Target 1)
- **Best Model:** CNN + LSTM (MSE: 0.0036, R²: 0.7463)
- **Second Best:** CNN + GRU

#### Heating Load (Target 2)
- **Best Model:** CNN + LSTM (MSE: 0.0263, R²: -0.1994)  
- **Alternative:** CNN + BGRU showed potential

## Conclusion

The **CNN + LSTM** model demonstrated the best overall performance across all three load types, particularly excelling in electric and cooling load predictions. Although the **CNN + GRU** model showed competitive results, the standalone **CNN** model underperformed, which highlights the importance of recurrent architectures in modeling time-series energy data.

---

## Recommendations

- **Model Selection:**  
  Adopt CNN + LSTM as the primary model for energy load forecasting.

---

## Future Improvements

- **Hybrid Architectures:**  
  Explore combinations of CNN, BiGRU, and LSTM for potentially better performance.
  
- **Feature Enhancement:**  
  Incorporate additional weather and temporal features into the model.

- **Extended Testing:**  
  Evaluate model performance on longer time periods to capture seasonal variations.
